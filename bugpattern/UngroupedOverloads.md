## The problem
The [Google Java Style Guide ยง3.4.2.1][style] requires overloads to be grouped
together:

> When a class has multiple constructors, or multiple methods with the same
> name, these appear sequentially, with no other code in between (not even
> private members).

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("UngroupedOverloads")` to the enclosing element.
